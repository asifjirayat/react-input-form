# React Form Validation Example

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional form in React using:

## ðŸ”§ Features & Concepts

- **React State (`useState`)** â€“ For managing input validity.
- **Refs (`useRef`)** â€“ To access input values directly without two-way binding.
- **Forward Refs (`forwardRef`)** â€“ So parent components can reference child inputs.
- **Imperative Handle (`useImperativeHandle`)** â€“ To expose custom methods from inputs (if extended).
- **Portals (`createPortal`)** â€“ For rendering the dialog outside the main DOM tree.
- **HTML5 `<dialog>` Element** â€“ For showing a modal confirmation message after successful validation.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ For styling the UI.

## âœ… Validation Logic

- Name: required
- Email: must include `@`
- Password: minimum 6 characters

## ðŸ§  Behavior

- Inputs show red borders when invalid.
- On successful validation, a modal dialog confirms submission.
- The form resets when the dialog closes.
